# üé§ Meeting to Jira System üöÄ

**Stop taking meeting notes. Start creating tickets. Automatically.**

This project is a full-stack application that transforms meeting recordings into actionable Jira tickets. It uses AI to transcribe audio, extract requirements, and create tasks, bugs, and stories directly in your Jira project, streamlining your workflow and ensuring no action item gets lost.

## ‚ú® About The Project

In fast-paced development cycles, crucial decisions and action items discussed in meetings can easily be forgotten or lost in translation. This tool was built to solve that problem by creating a seamless bridge between conversation and execution.

Simply upload a meeting recording (MP3, WAV, MP4, etc.), and the system will:

- **Transcribe** the entire conversation using a self-hosted Whisper model for privacy and cost-effectiveness
- **Analyze** the transcription using the Gemini AI API to intelligently identify and extract software requirements, tasks, and bugs
- **Create** well-structured tickets in your specified Jira project, complete with summaries, descriptions, and acceptance criteria

This frees up developers and project managers from manual note-taking, allowing them to focus on what truly matters: building great software.
