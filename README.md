üé§ Meeting to Jira System üöÄ
Stop taking meeting notes. Start creating tickets. Automatically.

This project is a full-stack application that transforms meeting recordings into actionable Jira tickets. It uses AI to transcribe audio, extract requirements, and create tasks, bugs, and stories directly in your Jira project, streamlining your workflow and ensuring no action item gets lost.

‚ú® About The Project
In fast-paced development cycles, crucial decisions and action items discussed in meetings can easily be forgotten or lost in translation. This tool was built to solve that problem by creating a seamless bridge between conversation and execution.

Simply upload a meeting recording (MP3, WAV, MP4, etc.), and the system will:

Transcribe the entire conversation using a self-hosted Whisper model for privacy and cost-effectiveness.

Analyze the transcription using the Gemini AI API to intelligently identify and extract software requirements, tasks, and bugs.

Create well-structured tickets in your specified Jira project, complete with summaries, descriptions, and acceptance criteria.

This frees up developers and project managers from manual note-taking, allowing them to focus on what truly matters: building great software.

üöÄ Features
Seamless File Upload: A modern, drag-and-drop interface for uploading meeting recordings.

Self-Hosted Transcription: Uses faster-whisper for fast, private, and free audio-to-text conversion.

AI-Powered Requirement Extraction: Leverages the Gemini API to understand the transcription and pull out actionable items.

Automatic Jira Ticket Creation: Creates tickets in Jira with pre-filled summaries, descriptions, and labels.

Real-Time Progress Tracking: The frontend polls the backend to show the user the live status of the transcription and ticket creation process.

Scalable Backend: Built with FastAPI for high performance and asynchronous request handling.

Modern Frontend: A responsive and beautiful UI built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Containerized for Easy Deployment: Fully containerized with Docker and NGINX for consistent and simple deployment.

Database Migrations: Uses Alembic to manage database schema changes safely.
