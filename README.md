# üé§ Meeting to Jira System üöÄ

**Stop taking meeting notes. Start creating tickets. Automatically.**

This project is a full-stack application that transforms meeting recordings into actionable Jira tickets. It uses AI to transcribe audio, extract requirements, and create tasks, bugs, and stories directly in your Jira project, streamlining your workflow and ensuring no action item gets lost.

## ‚ú® About The Project

In fast-paced development cycles, crucial decisions and action items discussed in meetings can easily be forgotten or lost in translation. This tool was built to solve that problem by creating a seamless bridge between conversation and execution.

Simply upload a meeting recording (MP3, WAV, MP4, etc.), and the system will:

- **Transcribe** the entire conversation using a self-hosted Whisper model for privacy and cost-effectiveness
- **Analyze** the transcription using the Gemini AI API to intelligently identify and extract software requirements, tasks, and bugs
- **Create** well-structured tickets in your specified Jira project, complete with summaries, descriptions, and acceptance criteria

This frees up developers and project managers from manual note-taking, allowing them to focus on what truly matters: building great software.

## üöÄ Features

- **Seamless File Upload**: A modern, drag-and-drop interface for uploading meeting recordings
- **Self-Hosted Transcription**: Uses faster-whisper for fast, private, and free audio-to-text conversion
- **AI-Powered Requirement Extraction**: Leverages the Gemini API to understand the transcription and pull out actionable items
- **Automatic Jira Ticket Creation**: Creates tickets in Jira with pre-filled summaries, descriptions, and labels
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: The frontend polls the backend to show the user the live status of the transcription and ticket creation process
- **Scalable Backend**: Built with FastAPI for high performance and asynchronous request handling
- **Modern Frontend**: A responsive and beautiful UI built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS
- **Database Migrations**: Uses Alembic to manage database schema changes safely

## üìã Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamarJyoti496/meeting-to-jira.git
cd meeting-to-jira
```

### 2. Set up the environment configuration:

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and fill in your credentials for:

- `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., your Neon DB connection string)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- `JIRA_SERVER`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, and `JIRA_API_TOKEN`

### 3. Set up the Python backend:

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up the database:

Run the Alembic migrations to create the database tables:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 5. Set up the React frontend:

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Return to the root directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Start the backend server:

From the root directory, run:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Start the frontend development server:

In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running!

- **Backend API** available at http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend** accessible at http://localhost:3000
